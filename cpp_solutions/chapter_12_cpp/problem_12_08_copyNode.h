Chapter 12 - Problem 08 - Copy Node

Problem Statement:
Write a method that takes a pointer to a Node structure as a parameter
and returns a complete copy of the passed in data structure. The Node
data structure contains two pointers to other Nodes.

Solution:
For ease of testability, we will use SinglyLinkedNode for this problem
despite the fact that it contains a pointer to only one other node. The
difference in implementation for a node with two children is only one extra
line of code with a recursive call.
We recursively explore the linked list, creating a new node for each node
we find along the way.

Time complexity: O(N) - one operation is done for each connected node.
Space complexity: O(N) - because of recursion, N function calls go on the stack.
