Chapter 12 - Problem 02 - Reverse - CTCI 6th Edition page 163

Problem Statement:
Given a string represented as a null terminated char array, reverse it.

Example:
"Alex" -> "xelA"

Solution:
Make a copy of the pointer to the front of the string and advance it until it reaches the end of the string.
Once it reaches the end of the string, advance the front pointer forward and the end pointer backward while
swapping the pointed-to values along the way using only a single char as a buffer.

Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
