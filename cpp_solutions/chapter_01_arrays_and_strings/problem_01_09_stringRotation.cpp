Chapter 01 - Problem 09 - String Rotation - CTCI 6th Edition page 91

Problem Statement:
Assume you have a method isSubstring() which checks if one word is a substring of
another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using
only one call to isSubstring().

Example:
stringRotation("waterbottle", "erbottlewat")

Solution:
If we concatenate s1 with itself into [s1, s1] we will create a string that contains
every possible rotation of s1. For example "waterbottlewaterbottle" contains
"erbottlewat". Thus, if we use isSubstring() to check if s2 is a substring of
[s1, s1], we will determine if s2 is a rotation of s1.

Time complexity: O(N) where N is the length of the concatenated string. Substring checking can be done in linear time.
Space complexity: O(N) because we have to allocate enough space to double the length of s1.
